Sure! Let's summarize everything concisely, using a step-by-step explanation, and incorporate the example you requested to help clarify the purpose of the `target/` and `.m2/repository/` directories.

### **What Happens When You Run `mvn clean install`?**

1. **`mvn clean install`** is a common Maven command that does two main things:
   - **`clean`**: Deletes the contents of the `target/` directory (where Maven stores build output like compiled classes, packaged JARs, etc.). It ensures that your project starts with a fresh state, removing any old files from previous builds.
   - **`install`**: This does several things:
     1. **Compiles the project**: It compiles the source code into bytecode (Java classes).
     2. **Runs tests**: If you have unit tests, it runs them to verify the correctness of your code.
     3. **Packages the code**: It packages your code into a JAR (or other format, depending on the project).
     4. **Installs the artifact**: It places the generated artifact (e.g., `hello-world-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) into your **local repository** (`~/.m2/repository/`) so that it can be used by other projects.

   After running `mvn clean install`:
   - The **`target/` directory** contains the packaged artifact (JAR, WAR, etc.), which is only relevant to your current project.
   - The **local repository (`.m2/repository/`)** contains the installed artifact and metadata, making it available for **other projects** on your machine to use as a dependency.

### **Why is the JAR in Both `target/` and `.m2/repository/`?**

- **`target/` directory**: This is where Maven stores the **current build artifacts** during the build process (compiled classes, JARs, etc.). It's a temporary directory used **only for the current project**. Once you run the `mvn clean` command, everything in `target/` is deleted, ensuring you have a clean slate for the next build.

- **`.m2/repository/`**: This is where Maven stores **installed artifacts**. When you run `mvn install`, Maven installs the built JAR into the **local repository** (`.m2/repository/`). This repository is meant for **reusing artifacts across multiple projects**. Once the artifact is installed in `.m2/repository/`, it can be used by any other Maven project on your system, avoiding the need to rebuild the same artifact multiple times.

### **Example Scenario: How Artifacts Are Used Across Projects**

Let’s walk through an example with **two projects**:

1. **Project A**: A utility library you develop.
2. **Project B**: An application that depends on **Project A**.

#### Step 1: Build **Project A**

1. You run `mvn clean install` in **Project A**.
   - **`clean`**: Deletes the `target/` folder (if it exists from a previous build).
   - **`install`**: Builds the project, packages it as a JAR (e.g., `project-a-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`), and installs it into your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository/com/example/project-a/1.0-SNAPSHOT/project-a-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`).

2. After this, you’ll have:
   - **`target/`**: Contains the **compiled JAR** (`project-a-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) for the current project.
   - **`.m2/repository/`**: Contains the same **JAR file** (`project-a-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`), which is now available for use in other projects (like **Project B**).

#### Step 2: Use **Project A** in **Project B**

1. Now, you have a separate project, **Project B**, which depends on **Project A**.
   
2. In **Project B’s `pom.xml`**, you add a dependency on **Project A**:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.example</groupId>
     <artifactId>project-a</artifactId>
     <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

3. When you run `mvn clean install` in **Project B**, Maven checks if **Project A** is already available in the local repository (`.m2/repository/`):
   - If the JAR is found in `.m2/repository/` (which it is, from when you built Project A), Maven uses it as a **dependency** and includes it in the build for **Project B**.
   - If **Project A’s JAR** was not in `.m2/repository/`, Maven would either:
     1. Download it from a remote repository (if it's a public artifact) or
     2. Build and install it from your local Project A if it's not yet installed.

### **Key Points**

1. **`target/` directory**:
   - Stores **build artifacts** (JAR, WAR, etc.) generated for the **current project**.
   - It’s **temporary**—gets cleared by `mvn clean`.

2. **`.m2/repository/`**:
   - Stores **installed artifacts** that can be **shared** across multiple Maven projects on your machine.
   - It holds **dependencies** for any project that references them in their `pom.xml`.
   - This directory **is not cleared** by `mvn clean` because it holds **persistent dependencies** that may be used by **other projects**.

3. **Why are artifacts stored in both places?**
   - **`target/`**: For temporary, project-specific artifacts that are part of the current build.
   - **`.m2/repository/`**: For installed, reusable artifacts (dependencies) that can be shared across projects.

4. **Dependency Management Across Projects**:
   - When you build **Project A**, it installs the JAR into the local repository (`.m2/repository/`).
   - When you build **Project B**, Maven finds **Project A’s JAR** in `.m2/repository/` and uses it as a dependency.
   - This prevents you from having to rebuild the same dependencies for every project, and ensures that different projects can reuse the same artifact versions.

### **Conclusion**

The `.m2/repository/` directory is where Maven stores **artifacts** that can be used across multiple projects, ensuring that dependencies are shared and managed efficiently. The `target/` directory, on the other hand, is specific to each project and holds temporary build artifacts that are cleaned up after the build. The `mvn clean install` command ensures that your project is built cleanly and that the artifacts are installed into `.m2/repository/` for reuse in future builds or other projects.
